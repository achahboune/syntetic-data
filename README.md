# syntetic-data
This code will generate 100 synthetic records and save them to a CSV file named synthetic_data.csv in the same directory as your Python script. Feel free to adjust the num_records variable to generate more or fewer records as needed. Additionally, you can modify the data fields and add more fields according to your specific requirements.
